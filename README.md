Jumper Game

Josh Smith

This is a jumper game, kind of like hangman where you get a random word and have to guess the word before your parachute runs out. I used 4 classes in this program, the main class, a director, player and then puzzle class. The director class brings together the classes and directs the flow of the code while the puzzle class is used to hold the guessing words and also can choose the word, while the player class is in charge of getting the player guesses and lives. The main program class is what runs the code.
